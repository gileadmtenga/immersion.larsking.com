                                Pointholding is a powerfully transformative approach to releasing trauma and stuck energy, with consistently profound, permanent, 
                                and liberating results. This practice involves applying sustained pressure to neurosomatic points on the body, granting access to the 
                                limbic system, the emotional command center of the brain. It's here that we can unlock and gently release what's been held inside, often
                                for a long time. You'll lay comfortably on a massage table while two points at the base of the skull are held. If there are other pointholders 
                                present, they'll hold other specific points on your body (which correspond to specific meridian points in Chinese Medicine).
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Sessions resolve old traumatic imprints, allowing you to process and permanently release past emotions and negative beliefs at the root. 
                                One of the most special things about this is how profoundly safe and easy it is to “go there,” and how the subconscious serves up exactly 
                                what you are ready for (based on your intention for the session). Pointholding offers a unique channel to the wisdom of your body, cultivating 
                                a new level of embodied connection with Self that leads to life-altering changes. I have facilitated and experienced miracles through this work. 
                                I asked Judith Johnson, one of my mentors and a pioneer of this work, if she sees this as the most powerful somatic healing modality on the planet. 
                                She responded “Yes, nothing touches it.” I sometimes call the experience an “internal power wash” for how clean and clear we often feel afterward 😊.

                                <br>
                                All those present for these sessions, including pointholders, are blessed by the process. Holding these points allows for all involved to plug into 
                                the purity of what is occurring. While trauma occurs in the darkness, pointholding sessions occur in the light and hands of a sacred container. 
                                The process alone is incredibly powerful; being witnessed and physically held in it is a gift of its own.

                                I used to run longer pointholding retreats at $3500, and while it was very much worth the investment for attendees, 
                                I wanted to make the experience more accessible and a simpler fit into people's schedules 
                                (while also keeping it as valuable and integration focused as I could). That's why I shortened it to one full Saturday, 
                                where attendees can have a self-guided integration day on Sunday. The investment is about 1/4 of what it used to be, 
                                with more facilitators (3 facilitators for 6 attendees), more preparation support, and generous payment plans if necessary.
